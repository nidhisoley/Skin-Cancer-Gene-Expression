## Skin-Cancer-Gene-Expression

Key Statistics:

Melanoma accounts for only about 1% of skin cancers but causes a large majority of skin cancer deaths

Correlating finding with known:
MFSD12 is expressed in lysosomes, a distinct organelle from the melanosomes that produce eumelanin- responsible for more pigmentation.
Other overexpressed gene in the Hispanic and Latino group MC1R, LGMN, SLC2A1 are all associated with darker pigmentary.
The immune and inflammatory responses to UV exposure are partially mediated by the MC1R gene. Plausible reason of protection from UV radiation in Hispanic or Latino group.

Correlating finding with known:
Melanoma cells interact with other cells via extracellular vesicles they secrete.CTHRC1,FN1, ITGB3- are some overexpressed genes. CTHRC1 is involved in melanoma cells, activated stromal fibroblasts, and blood vessel endothelial cell.
Females have over expressed ESR2, a gene for estrogen receptor beta (Erβ) which is associated with binding functions.
ERβ has a tumor-suppressive function and displays a protective role in the metastatic process.
